        The prerequisites to become president of the USA was established by the Founding Fathers during the written of the constitution since 1787. They were designed to ensure the candidate a minimum of loyalty and experience. The president must be a natural-born citizen at least 35 years old and must resided in the USA for 14 years. These prerequisites are written in the Article II of the Constitution and they ensure that the president has a strong connection with the country and is sufficiently mature to lead the nation. A politician can be president only two times (since 21 March 1947)

        In the USA election the process begin with the primaries, where the voters from each party the Democratic or Republican choose their candidate for the presidency. Then during the general election citizens vote for a presidential candidate but this vote is indirect. In reality, they are electing electors who form the Electoral College. Each state has a number of electors proportional to its population (for example California has 54 while Wyoming has 3). To be elected president, a candidate must obtain at least 270 electors out of 538. A candidate can become president by winning most electors, even if they do not have the majority at national level (popular vote).

          The history of American elections begins in 1789 with the election of George Washington. The system based on an Electoral College evolved with the expansion of voting rights to non-property-owning men, women and 18-year-olds. The major parties are the Democrats and Republicans they emerged in the 19th century.
